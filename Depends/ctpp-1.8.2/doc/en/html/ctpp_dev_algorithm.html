<h3>Algorithm</h3><br>

Process of work CT++ template engine contains four parts:<br>
<ol>
<li>Initialization
<li>Parsing template file
<li>Imposing of parameters (the first pass)
<li>Imposing of parameters (the second pass) and a conclusion of results
</ol>
In the first stage occurs loading of the text of a pattern, automatic loading standard functions set and initialization of necessary variables.<br><br>
The second stage is a construction of a tree of syntactic analysis of a template file. All syntactic errors are generated at this stage.<br><br>
During the first pass (the third stage) there is an imposing the parameters which are taking place outside of cycles. It gives a prize for simple patterns in which the simple conclusion of parameters (without conditions and cycles) prevails.<br><br>
Last stage - imposing of parameters on structures of cycles and conditions and the further conclusion of results.<br><br>
